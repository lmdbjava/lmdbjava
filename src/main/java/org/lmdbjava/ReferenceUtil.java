  /**
   * Ensures that the object referenced by the given reference remains <em>strongly reachable</em>,
   * regardless of any prior actions of the program that might otherwise cause the object to become
   * unreachable. Thus, the referenced object is not reclaimable by garbage collection at least
   * until after the invocation of this method.
   *
   * <p>Recent versions of the JDK have a nasty habit of prematurely deciding objects are
   * unreachable (eg <a href="https://tinyurl.com/so26642153">StackOverflow question 26642153</a>.
   *
   * <p><code>java.lang.ref.Reference.reachabilityFence</code> offers a solution to this problem,
   * but it was only introduced in Java 9. LmdbJava presently supports Java 8 and therefore this
   * method provides an alternative.
   *
   * <p>This method works because HotSpot JIT-compilers prune dead locals based on method bytecode
   * analysis rather than optimized IR. As Vladimir Ivanov explains: "any usage of a local extends
   * its live range, even if that usage is eliminated in generated code". The method call at the
   * bytecode level is sufficient to keep the object alive through safepoints, preventing premature
   * garbage collection during native operations.
   *
   * @param ref the reference
   * @see <a href="https://mail.openjdk.org/pipermail/core-libs-dev/2018-February/051312.html">
